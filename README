A phpBB3 extension to allow websites written in other language than phpBB3 to interact with forum engine by
using a simple RESTful API.

Currently the whole project is in Alpha stage, all contributions are welcome tho.

Active "stuff":
  * session fetching (GET app.php/connector/session/<sid>)
  * user fetching (GET app.php/connector/user/<user_id>)
  * user editing (POST app.php/connector/user/<user_id>; Need to specify safe attributes in ACP)
  * ACL test (POST app.php/connector/user/<user_id>/acl; options variable containing comma separated privileges (a_*, u_*, f_*))
    * Note, currently works only for global test (acl_gets method)
  * Authentication (POST app.php/connector/user/auth; Pass username and password, useful for building APIs)

Things that would probaly be useful:
  * fetching topics and posts
  * fetching list of private messages
  * etc.

Motivation:

One would argue, these features could be done by directly communicating with the backend database. Mainly
it is true, but in the ACL case, you'll have to replicate the whole ACL logic. Also, by using this extension
you do not need to worry about compatibility with various SQL RDBMS. Not to mention, future phpBB3 versions
might implement a wrapping layer around the backend storage and add some caching that could be synchronised
(which would be "impossible" to do by directly fetching data from database).

Used by:
  * https://github.com/MasterMind2k/flask-phpbb3 (planned as of 29. 5. 2015)

=======================
WARNING WARNING WARNING

This API is intended to be used by internal backend services, it should be protected by authentication key
(built-in) and by list of allowed IPs (apropriate config options in HTTP server).
